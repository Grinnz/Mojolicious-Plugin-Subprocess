=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Subprocess - Subprocesses in Mojolicious applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojolicious::Lite;
  
  plugin 'Subprocess';
  
  get '/slow' => sub {
    my $c = shift;
    $c->subprocess(sub {
      return do_slow_stuff();
    }, sub {
      my ($c, @results) = @_;
      $c->render(json => \@results);
    });
  };
  
  # or use Sereal as serializer
  plugin 'Subprocess' => {use_sereal => 1};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Subprocess> is a L<Mojolicious> plugin that adds a
L</"subprocess"> helper method to your application, which uses
L<Mojo::IOLoop::Subprocess> to perform computationally expensive operations in
subprocesses without blocking the event loop.

The option C<use_sereal> (requires L<Mojo::IOLoop::Subprocess::Role::Sereal>)
will use L<Sereal> for data serialization, which is faster than L<Storable> and
supports serialization of more reference types such as C<Regexp>. The
L<Sereal::Encoder/"FREEZE/THAW CALLBACK MECHANISM"> is supported to control
serialization of blessed objects.

Any other options passed to the plugin will be used as attributes to build the
L<Mojo::IOLoop::Subprocess> object.

Note that it does not increase the timeout of the connection, so if your forked
process is going to take a very long time, you might need to increase that
using L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"inactivity_timeout">.

=head1 HELPERS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Subprocess> implements the following helpers.

=head2 subprocess

 $c->subprocess(sub {
   my $subprocess = shift;
   ...
 }, sub {
   my ($c, @results) = @_;
   ...
 });

Execute the first callback in a child process with
L<Mojo::IOLoop::Subprocess/"run">, and execute the second callback in the
parent process with the results. The callbacks are executed via
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"delay">, which disables automatic
rendering, keeps a reference to the transaction, and renders an exception
response if an exception is thrown in either callback. This also means that the
parent callback will not be called if an exception is thrown in the child
callback.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Subprocess> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 register

 $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new);
 $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new, {ioloop => $ioloop});

Register helper in L<Mojolicious> application.
